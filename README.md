# dog_app

# Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Data Scientist Nanodegree! 
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline
that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world,
user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.
If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

# Instructions

- Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

git clone https://github.com/Aniket2011/dog_app

cd dog-project

- Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages.

- Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/lfw. If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder.

- Donwload the VGG-16 bottleneck features for the dog dataset. Place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features.
